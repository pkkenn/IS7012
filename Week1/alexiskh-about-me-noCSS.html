    <h2>Why I am in my program:</h2>
    <p>My pursuit of an MS-IS degree at UC's Lindner College of Business stems from a deep-rooted desire to support my 		family, embrace lifelong learning, and elevate my career.
    Throughout my life, I have embraced the concept of being a student of life, valuing each encounter and situation as an	opportunity to learn and grow. So having majored in IS as an undergrad student and liking it, I pursued an MS-IS!

    <h3>Swimming</h3>
    <blockquote>Another physical activity that I absolutely truly enjoy is <b>swimming</b> It provides the benefits of basketball with less stress to the body. It is also a fun activity to do while on vacation. And unlike basketball, it can actually save your life or the life of another.
